    "description": "The exhibit examines the intersection between art, narrative, and geography within Japanese cartography. It centers on the titular \u201cmanga map\u201d, a rare Japanese travel map of Japan (ca. 1934) that is densely packed with manga illustrations detailing local folklore, history, architecture, flora/fauna, and more. The exhibit also includes works of Japanese art and cartography in order to consider the dichotomy between artistry and geographic depiction, and how that plays with the definition of a \u201cmap.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlongside the exhibit, the manga map is also part of a new digital humanities preservation project at the library using the online crowd-sourcing platform Zooniverse, where the map will be transcribed/translated and made into a fully interactive digital map. More information is available at the exhibit.\r\n\r\nBoth the exhibit and the Zooniverse project were created as a summer internship capstone project by Joel Liesenberg, a dual-degree master\u2019s student in International and Regional Studies focusing in Japanese studies and the School of Information focusing in digital curation."

    "event_type": "Exhibition",
    "description": "This exhibit incorporates a selection of work from the Shadow and Light project, an initiative memorializing Iraqi academics assassinated between 2003-2013, a timeframe which roughly parallels the US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq.\u00a0\r\n\r\nParticipants from around the world \u2014 including Iraqis in diaspora \u2014 contributed photographs and personal statements responding to the loss of a particular Iraqi academic listed by the Spanish Campaign against the Occupation and for the Sovereignty of Iraq (La Campa\u00f1a Estatal contra la Ocupaci\u00f3n y por la Soberan\u00eda de Iraq / IraqSolidaridad 2005-2013).\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe project emerges from a broader effort undertaken by Iraqis and allies to document the assault on Iraqi scholars, intellectuals, and cultural institutions which flared in the wake of the destruction and division wrought by the US-led invasion and occupation. Death threats and assassinations, politically motivated sectarian violence, rampant corruption, and de-Ba\u2019athification policies only further destabilized an educational system already heaving under the devastation of wars, authoritarian regimes, and harsh economic sanctions.\r\n\r\nThis exhibit invites solidarity with the academics targeted, but also deeper connection with their experiences and the richness of Iraqi academic life through their written legacies and the testimonies of surviving academics, many of whom were driven into exile.\r\n\r\nThis exhibit in the north lobby is available during Hatcher Library hours (https://myumi.ch/p75dd).\r\n\r\nA companion online exhibit, Tracing Iraqi Artists: From Shadow to Light (https://myumi.ch/n7xre), explores modern Iraqi struggle and resistance through contemporary visual art and connection to Iraqi artists and educators. The curators of the online exhibit, 2023 Michigan Library Scholars Zainab Hakim and Serena Safawi, hope to center surviving Iraqi artists as they explore their national and artistic identities and respond to the cycles of violence caused by the Iran-Iraq war, sanctions, and occupation."

    "event_type": "Exhibition",
    "description": "This exhibit showcases select photographs from The American University in Cairo\u2019s Rare Books and Special Collections Library taken by the renowned Egyptian photographer Abd al-Fattah Eid as well as by the Cairo-born Swiss artist Margo Veillon.\r\n\r\nIn 1964, the construction of the Aswan High Dam displaced Nubians from their ancestral villages along the banks of the Nile in Egypt. In the years immediately preceding the dam\u2019s construction, the American University in Cairo directed a large-scale project of salvage anthropology with funding from the Ford Foundation. \r\n\r\nThis endeavor yielded hundreds of photographs of al-nuba al-qadima or \u201cOld Nubia\u201d the term affectionately used by community members. Over the past sixty years, Nubians have used these images to cultivate a collective memory of a lost homeland. From Aswan to Alexandria and beyond, community members are salvaging their own stories from this anthropological archive, reshaping it as a sentimental terrain of solidarity across time, space, and circumstance. \r\n\r\nThis selection of photographs includes persons, places, and practices as well as glimpses of the presence of the photographer and researchers. Both online and offline, Egyptian Nubians continue to share and re-mediate these photos as they recall their historical displacement and revitalize their heritage for future generations.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit is curated by Yasmin Moll, assistant professor of anthropology, and coordinated by Nesrien Hamid, doctoral student in anthropology, with funding from the University of Michigan's Humanities Collaboratory.\r\n\r\nFor a deeper dive, visit the companion exhibit, Narrating Nubia, at the Duderstadt Center on North Campus. It delves into the archaeological, anthropological, and community narratives of both ancient and modern-day Nubia spanning Egypt and Sudan."

    "event_type": "Exhibition",
    "description": "Enjoy a selection of manuscripts and early printed books from the 15th to the 17th centuries that were illustrated with illuminations and woodcuts. Throughout the European Renaissance (1300-1700), many book illustrations were exclusively ornamental, while others focused on enhancing the meaning of the text. However, as the pages on display attest, all these illustrations share a common ground: they reveal the aesthetic and intellectual fashions first proposed by Italian artists of the 1400s, who were strongly committed to the recovery of the past of classical antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe word \u201cIllumination,\u201d from the Latin illuminare, \u201cto enlighten or to illuminate,\u201d refers to the embellishment of a manuscript or early printed book with luminous colors, notably gold and silver. This illumination was prominent in the frontispiece, or first page of text, which included the decoration of its borders and initial letter, and even miniatures, that is, scenes with an independent narrative. With the introduction of movable-type printing in 1454, these illuminations would be gradually replaced by woodcuts, which were printed from a woodblock that had been cut by knife along the grain of the wood.\r\n\r\nAvailable during Hatcher Gallery Exhibit Room hours (https://myumi.ch/2m7d4).\r\n\r\nJoin us on September 13 for a talk by Pablo Alvarez, curator of the exhibit."

Located in the former Homestake gold mine in Lead, South Dakota, the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) houses experiments that give us a better understanding of the universe. The location\u2014deep underground\u2014provides a near-perfect environment for experiments that need to escape the constant bombardment of cosmic radiation, which can interfere with the detection of rare physics events. Built in collaboration with the University of Michigan, the LUX-Zeplin is the world\u2019s most sensitive dark matter experiment. SURF also hosts experiments in biology, geology and engineering.\r\n\r\nGina Gibson is an internationally exhibiting artist and professor of Graphic Design at Black Hills State University. In 2019, Gibson became the first artist in residence at the Sanford Underground Research Facility. Gibson's work celebrates the search deep below the surface for beauty in the old and new, the light and dark, and the known and unknown.\r\n\r\nUN/EARTH was developed in collaboration with the U-M Department of Physics, the Sanford Underground Research Facility and Black Hills State University."

    "description": "How Do We Remember?\u00a0\n \nMemories are deeply embedded in the physical structures of modern day society \u2014 our neighborhoods, our laws, our monuments, our buildings \u2014 but those memories are often sculpted and built into those structures by a privileged few. How have their perspectives shaped the enduring stories of our history and visions of the past?\n \nYou\u2019re Welcome is a three-part installation and dynamic intervention that exposes the histories and narratives of the land occupied by the University of Michigan and UMMA\u2019s neoclassical building, Alumni Memorial Hall. A large-scale commission from artist Cannupa Hanska Luger on the exterior of UMMA\u2019s building asks the campus and community to reconsider the memories molded into the Museum\u2019s stone \u2014 the perspectives that shaped those traditions and the stories that remain unseen in our facade. This artistic interrogation dissects colonialist norms of monument-making, explores the roles of buildings in upholding selected cultural systems, and develops new forms of memorials that center Indigenous perspectives and collaboration to tell fuller stories and histories.\u00a0\n \nLuger communicates stories of 21st-century Indigeneity, sovereignty, and anti-colonialism while offering critical cultural analysis through deep engagements with materials, environments, and communities. In addition to the exterior commission, a gallery exhibition places Luger\u2019s works of art in conversation with objects in UMMA\u2019s collection, allowing for discussion and thinking on long histories of collecting practices, environmental degradation, and the afterlife of colonialism. And, a monument classroom from nonprofit public art and history studio Monument Lab invites the community to come together and examine how historic structures on the University of Michigan\u2019s campus uphold social and cultural systems and narratives. \u00a0\n\nLead support for this project is provided by\u00a0Teiger Foundation, the U-M Office of the Provost,\u00a0the U-M Office of the President,\u00a0Erica\u00a0Gervais\u00a0Pappendick\u00a0and Ted\u00a0Pappendick, the U-M Marsal Family School of Education, the U-M Institute for the Humanities, Michigan Humanities,\u00a0and the U-M Arts Initiative.

A theme semester is a university-wide effort to engage with a subject of importance to learning across the disciplines and to public life and informed citizenship.\u00a0\n \nMore than 100 classes are being taugh this semester that engage with the theme, ranging from a political history of hula dance in American Culture to a class about carbon-climate interactions in the College of Engineering.

    "event_type": "Exhibition",
    "description": "Confront the past and celebrate the creative voices of an untold chapter of American history.\n \nHear Me Now: The Black Potters of Old Edgefield, South Carolina is a landmark exhibition of more than 60 objects representing the work of African American potters in the decades surrounding the Civil War.\u00a0\n \nIt is a reckoning with the central role that enslaved and free Black potters played in the long-standing stoneware traditions of Edgefield, South Carolina. It is also an important story about the unrelenting power of artistic expression and creativity, even while under the brutal conditions of slavery\u2014and about the joy, struggle, creative ambition, and lived experience of African Americans in the 19th-century American South.\n \nThe exhibition features many objects rarely seen outside of the South, bringing together monumental storage jars by the enslaved and literate potter and poet Dave, later recorded as David Drake (about 1800\u2013about 1870), along with rare examples of the region\u2019s utilitarian wares and powerful face vessels by potters once known but unrecorded.\u00a0\n \nThe inclusion of several contemporary works from leading Black artists links the past to the present in Hear Me Now. Established figures like Theaster Gates and Simone Leigh, as well as younger, emerging artists like Adebunmi Gbadebo, and Woody De Othello have contributed to the exhibition. Working primarily in clay, these artists respond to the legacy of the Edgefield potters and consider the resonance of this history for audiences today.\n \nCurated by Jason Young, Professor of History, University of Michigan; Adrienne Spinozzi, Associate Curator, American Wing, The Metropolitan Museum of Art; and Ethan Lasser, John Moors Cabot Chair, Art of the Americas, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\n\nhellow\n\nhellow\n\nHear Me Now\u00a0is organized by The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, with support from the Terra Foundation for American Art and the Henry Luce Foundation.\n\nLead support for\u00a0UMMA's\u00a0presentation of the exhibition is provided by Michigan Engineering, the U-M Office of the Provost, the Americana Foundation, the U-M College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the U-M Inclusive History Project, and Michigan Humanities.

    "description": "In conjunction with the Fall 2023 Theme Semester: Arts &amp; Resistance, Stamps Gallery is partnering with the U\u2011M Arts Initiative to expand the 4th annual Respond/Resist/Rethink student art exhibition. All undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at the Ann Arbor, Dearborn, or Flint U-M campuses in Fall 2023 are invited to apply to this juried exhibition that explores what can be done to create more just and equitable futures in the 21st Century and beyond.\n The 2023 exhibition will include art of a variety of mediums and will be displayed in four galleries across all three U-M campuses, including Stamps Gallery (Central Campus, Ann Arbor), Duderstadt Center Gallery (North Campus, Ann Arbor), Riverbank Arts (Flint), and Stamelos Gallery (Dearborn). \nThe arts play a central role in shaping cultural and political narratives. Artists, designers and creatives of diverse backgrounds have been at the forefront of social change by offering alternate models and ways of thinking, making and creating that do not perpetuate dominant regimes. Creative processes have been used time and again to reveal under-told stories and to resist simple narratives. Regardless of one&#039;s personal politics, an artwork&#039;s potential to change hearts and minds is urgent and necessary. \nRespond/ Resist/ Rethink invites students to leverage their creativity to (re)imagine what they can do to create a more just and equitable community in the spaces that they inhabit.\nThroughout the spring, summer, and fall of 2023, U-M students submitted artworks through an open call process. A final list of artworks were chosen for the exhibition by a Selection Committee made up of U-M faculty, staff, and students. \n\nThe 2023 RRR Selection Committee members are: \nPedram Baldari, Jim Cogswell, Laura Cotton, Nalani Duarte, Adrienne Frank, Benjamin Gaydos, Kathryn Grabowski-Khairullah, Quinn Hunter, Ikalanni Jahi, Jennifer Junkermeier-Khan, Joe Levickas, Srimoyee Mitra, Kathi Reister, Chloe Schans, and Grace Sirman. \nThe 2023 RRR Curatorial Committee members are: \nLaura Cotton, Nalani Duarte, Benjamin Gaydos, Kathryn Grabowski-Khairullah, Srimoyee Mitra, and Kathi Reister. \nThe 2023 RRR Organizing Committee members are: Chris Audain, Adrienne Frank, Kathryn Grabowski-Khairullah, Jennifer Junkermeier-Khan, Joe Levickas, Srimoyee Mitra, and Joe Rohrer.

    "event_type": "Exhibition",
    "description": "The Blessings of the Mystery examines themes of socio-economic, environmental activism, encounters between history and memory, Indigenous rights, and the formation and distribution of knowledge. The exhibition examines the Amistad Dam in Del Rio, the largest dam in Rio Grande that is jointly managed by the United States and Mexico and other contested sites in the region to unravel layered histories, connections, and tensions present in West Texas through film, sculpture, installation, collage, and drawing. \nThe experimental documentary film Teaching of the Hands is the center point of the exhibition - as it combines oral histories, reenactments, and archival footage to narrate a complex history of colonization, migration, and ecological precarity, Told from the perspective of Juan Mancias, Chairman of the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe of Texas, scenes from the present day are woven together with those from 4,000 years in the past to investigate the transformation of Somi Se\u2019k* by way of industry, infrastructure, and private property. \nEmerging from the research to create the film, the exhibition includes an immersive installation of surveying flags and tools, series of drawings and collages, and a collection of original watercolors from the 1930s by artists and amateur archaeologists Forrest and Lula Kirkland that depict the ancient rock art of the Lower Pecos,that expand on concepts in The Teachings of the Hands. The watercolors, rarely seen plein air paintings, are on loan from the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas, and document the original forms and vibrant colors of murals that were still visible in the 1930s before flooding, erosion, and human interaction damaged or destroyed them. This exhibition has been shown in various iterations at Ballroom Marfa, the University of Texas at Austin, the Rubin Center for the Visual Arts, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and University of California, Santa Barbara, and will be shown in Michigan and the midwest for the first time. The Blessings of the Mystery brings together an expansive body of work that sheds light on vital histories, living memories and Indigenous knowledge-systems embedded within the land well before the colonial boundaries between Mexico and the US were established - advocating for environmental justice and recognition of Indigenous rights and cosmologies."

    "event_type": "Exhibition",
    "description": "Organized as a response to the Museum\u2019s recent acquisition of Titus Kaphar\u2019s Flay (James Madison), this upcoming reinstallation of one of our most prominent gallery spaces forces us to grapple with our collection of European and American art, 1650-1850.\n \nIn recent times, growing public awareness of the continued reverberations of the legacy of slavery and colonization has challenged museums to examine the uncomfortable histories contained in our collections, and challenged the public to probe the choices we make about those stories. Choices about which artists you see in our galleries, choices about what relevant facts we share about the works, and choices about what - out of an infinite number of options - we don\u2019t say about them.\n \nPieces in this exhibition were made at a time when the world came to be shaped by the ideologies of colonial expansion and Western domination. And yet, that history and the stories of those marginalized do not readily appear in the still lives and portraits on display here. By grappling with what is visible and what remains hidden, we are forced to examine whose stories and histories are prioritized and why.\u00a0\u00a0\n \nIn this online exhibition, you can explore our efforts to deeply question the Museum\u2019s collection and our own past complicity in favoring colonial voices. In the Museum gallery, which will open in early 2021, you\u2019ll be able to experience the changes we\u2019re making to the physical space to highlight a more honest version of European and American history.\u00a0\n \nBy challenging our own practice, and continuing to add to what we know and what we write about the works we display, UMMA tells a more complex and more complete story of this nation - one that unsettles, and fails to settle for, simple narratives.\u00a0\n \n\u201cInvisible things are not necessarily \u2018not there\u2019.... Certain absences are so stressed, so ornate, so planned, they call attention to themselves; arrest us with intentionality and purpose, like neighborhoods that are defined by the population held away from them.\u201d\u00a0\n \n\u2014 Toni Morrison\n\nLead support for Unsettling Histories: Legacies of Slavery and Colonialism\u00a0is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost,\u00a0the U-M Arts Initiative, and the Susan and Richard Gutow Endowed Fund.\n\u00a0"

With I Write To You About Africa, we examine the subjective ways UMMA and the University of Michigan as a whole have collected and presented art from and connected to the African diaspora.\n \nDrawn from art collections across the U-M campus, a special section of the exhibition highlights how the founding of the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies (DAAS) and the African Studies Center (ASC) impacted U\u2013M\u2019s collecting practices. This section includes an exciting and ongoing project\u2014contemporary African artists, scholars, and curators will be asked to write about their work on postcards, in their first language, and mail them to UMMA where they will be displayed alongside their works.\u00a0\n \nWe Write To You About Africa will be a reinstallation of the Museum\u2019s Robert and Lillian Montalto Bohlen Gallery of African art and the connected Alfred A Taubman Gallery II.

    "description": "In the 1970s, Fereydoun Farrokhzad was a significant cultural icon, a sex symbol, and a chart-topping pop singer whose music and television programs were heard and viewed by millions of Iranians. A decade later, living in political exile in Germany, he still performed to sold-out audiences in Europe. That changed on August 7, 1992, when he was found brutally murdered in his apartment in Bonn. Neighbors said his dogs had been barking for two nights.\r\n\r\nThe murder, still unsolved, serves as the starting point for this new work by British-Iranian theater maker Javaad Alipoor, whose The Believers Are But Brothers was featured in the 2020 No Safety Net theater festival. Selected as one of The Guardian\u2019s Top Theatre Shows of 2022, Things Hidden \u201cgleefully mashes up genres, smashing together the quiet authority of the murder mystery podcast, the intimacy of autobiographical storytelling, and the visual spectacle of multimedia performance \u2014 while simultaneously deconstructing each of these forms.\u201d (The Guardian)"

    "description": "In the 1970s, Fereydoun Farrokhzad was a significant cultural icon, a sex symbol, and a chart-topping pop singer whose music and television programs were heard and viewed by millions of Iranians. A decade later, living in political exile in Germany, he still performed to sold-out audiences in Europe. That changed on August 7, 1992, when he was found brutally murdered in his apartment in Bonn. Neighbors said his dogs had been barking for two nights.\r\n\r\nThe murder, still unsolved, serves as the starting point for this new work by British-Iranian theater maker Javaad Alipoor, whose The Believers Are But Brothers was featured in the 2020 No Safety Net theater festival. Selected as one of The Guardian\u2019s Top Theatre Shows of 2022, Things Hidden \u201cgleefully mashes up genres, smashing together the quiet authority of the murder mystery podcast, the intimacy of autobiographical storytelling, and the visual spectacle of multimedia performance \u2014 while simultaneously deconstructing each of these forms.\u201d (The Guardian)"

    "event_type": "Performance",
    "description": "The University of Michigan Department of Dance presents *Hourglass Showers*, containing the works of senior BFA dance majors Anabelle Chalmers, Katherine Kiessling, Lauren Roebuck, and Mia Rubenstein. \n\nAnabelle Chalmers\u2019 choreography touches on themes of disaster, exploring the collapse of humanity and its effects on social and interpersonal relationships within the group. In Chalmers' solo, music and imagery are the driving forces of the piece, alongside the use of storytelling and vulnerability experienced throughout her movement. \n\nKatherine Kiessling\u2019s group work considers the various possibilities of who we become as individuals, focusing on how we seek escapes within the mundane. Meanwhile, Kiessling\u2019s solo focuses primarily on the catch and release of moving between the floor and standing, exploring all possibilities of entrances and exits.\n\nLauren Roebuck\u2019s, *She Cooks as Good as She Looks*, is loosely based on the film *The Stepford Wives*. It is a character-driven dance that critiques the traditional roles of a relationship between a man and a woman in the 21st century. Roebuck\u2019s solo, *Goldenheart*, is an ode to her childhood, evoking feelings of nostalgia, innocence, and happiness.\n\nMia Rubenstein\u2019s, *I Love You Like the Sun*, centers around the complexity of human nature, revealing how humans can be both beautiful and ugly all at once. Rubenstein\u2019s solo, *Vigilance*, deals with themes of self-doubt and the unknown that evidently leave ideas of certainty within the chaos. \n\nPerformances of this concert will be Thursday, November 16, through Saturday, November 18, 2023. Each show will begin at 8:00 p.m. (Livestreaming on November 17.) Tickets are free and are available at the door an hour prior to the performance."

When she was up in Somerville, Massachusetts, in the early nineties, knowing that she wanted to pursue music or theater, she worked backstage at the Opera Company of Boston and wrote plays on the side. But she was in Boston, and the muse led her into the myriad open mics and tip jar gigs of booming folk revival. She opened a trunk of old songs and started writing new ones. Dar still loves every minute of her job and always advises folks to \u201cfollow their muse.\u201d She still goes wherever the muse leads her, which, presently, is right back on her couch, coffee on the coffee table, guitar in hand, writing her next batch of songs.
