{"answer": "The event titled \"Manga no Ryokou: The \u201cManga Map\u201d and A Journey Through the Art of Depiction in Japanese Cartography\" is an exhibit that explores the intersection between art, narrative, and geography within Japanese cartography. The primary highlight of the exhibition is the \u201cmanga map\u201d, a rare Japanese travel map of Japan (ca. 1934) that is densely packed with manga illustrations detailing local folklore, history, architecture, flora/fauna, and more. It serves to consider the dichotomy between artistry and geographic depiction, and how that influences the definition of a \u201cmap\u201d.\n\nIn addition to the exhibit, the manga map is part of a new digital humanities preservation project at the library using the online crowd-sourcing platform Zooniverse, where the map will be transcribed/translated and converted into a fully interactive digital map. More information about this project is available at the event. The exhibit and the Zooniverse project were created by Joel Liesenberg, a dual-degree master\u2019s student in International and Regional Studies focusing on Japanese studies and the School of Information focusing on digital curation."}
